}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{The design matrix, without an intercept.  \code{grpreg}
    standardizes the data and includes an intercept by default.}
  \item{y}{The response vector, or a matrix in the case of multitask
    learning (see details).}
  \item{group}{A vector of describing the grouping of the coefficients.
    For greatest efficiency and least ambiguity (see details), it is
    best if \code{group} is a vector of consecutive integers, although
    unordered group and named groups are also allowed.  If there are
    coefficients to be included in the model without being penalized,
    assign them to group 0 (or \code{"0"}).}
  \item{penalty}{The penalty to be applied to the model.  For group
    selection, one of \code{grLasso}, \code{grMCP}, or \code{grSCAD}.
    For bi-level selection, one of \code{gel} or \code{cMCP}.  See
    below for details.}
  \item{family}{Either "gaussian" or "binomial", depending on the
    response.}
  \item{nlambda}{The number of \code{lambda} values.  Default is 100.}
  \item{lambda}{A user supplied sequence of \code{lambda} values.
    Typically, this is left unspecified, and the function automatically
    computes a grid of lambda values that ranges uniformly on the log 
    scale over the relevant range of lambda values.}
  \item{lambda.min}{The smallest value for \code{lambda}, as a fraction
    of \code{lambda.max}.  Default is .0001 if the number of observations
    is larger than the number of covariates and .05 otherwise.} 
  \item{alpha}{\code{grpreg} allows for both a group penalty and an L2
    (ridge) penalty; \code{alpha} controls the proportional weight of
    the regularization parameters of these two penalties.  The group
    penalties' regularization parameter is \code{lambda*alpha}, while
    the regularization parameter of the ridge penalty is
    \code{lambda*(1-alpha)}.  Default is 1: no ridge penalty.}
  \item{eps}{Convergence threshhold.  The algorithm iterates until the
    change (on the standardized scale) in any coefficient is less than
    \code{eps}.  Default is \code{.001}.  See details.}
  \item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations.  Default is 1000.  See
    details.}
  \item{dfmax}{Limit on the number of parameters allowed to be nonzero.
    If this limit is exceeded, the algorithm will exit early from the
    regularization path.}
  \item{gmax}{Limit on the number of groups allowed to have nonzero
    elements.  If this limit is exceeded, the algorithm will exit early
    from the regularization path.}
  \item{gamma}{Tuning parameter of the MCP penalty; defaults to 3.}
  \item{tau}{Tuning parameter for the group exponential lasso; defaults
    to 1/3.}
  \item{group.multiplier}{A vector of values representing multiplicative
    factors by which each group's penalty is to be multiplied.
    Often, this is a function (such as the square root) of the number of
    predictors in each group.  The default is to use the square root of
    group size for the group selection methods, and a vector of 1's
    (i.e., no adjustment for group size) for bi-level selection.}
  \item{warn}{Should the function give a warning if it fails to
    converge?  Default is TRUE.  See details.}
  \item{...}{Arguments passed to other functions (such as gBridge).}
}
\details{
  There are two general classes of methods involving grouped penalties:
  those that carry out bi-level selection and those that carry out group
  selection.  Bi-level means carrying out variable selection at the group
  level as well as the level of individual covariates (i.e., selecting
  important groups as well as important members of those groups).  Group
  selection selects important groups, and not members within the group --
  i.e., within a group, coefficients will either all be zero or all
  nonzero.  The \code{grLasso}, \code{grMCP}, and \code{grSCAD}
  penalties carry out group selection, while the \code{gel} and
  \code{cMCP} penalties carry out bi-level selection.  For bi-level
  selection, see also the \code{\link{gBridge}} function.  For
  historical reasons and backwards compatibility, some of these
  penalties have aliases; e.g., \code{gLasso} will do the same thing as
  \code{grLasso}, but users are encouraged to use \code{grLasso}.

  Please note the distinction between \code{grMCP} and \code{cMCP}.  The
  former involves an MCP penalty being applied to an L2-norm of each
  group.  The latter involves a hierarchical penalty which places an
  outer MCP penalty on a sum of inner MCP penalties for each group, as
  proposed in Breheny & Huang, 2009.  Either penalty may be referred to
  as the "group MCP", depending on the publication.  To resolve this
  confusion, Huang et al. (2012) proposed the name "composite MCP" for
  the \code{cMCP} penalty.

  For more information about the penalties and their properties, please
  consult the references below, many of which contain discussion, case
  studies, and simulation studies comparing the methods.  If you use
  \code{grpreg} for an analysis, please cite the appropriate reference.

  In keeping with the notation from the original MCP paper, the tuning
  parameter of the MCP penalty is denoted 'gamma'.  Note, however, that
  in Breheny and Huang (2009), \code{gamma} is denoted 'a'.

  The objective function is defined to be
  \deqn{\frac{1}{2n}RSS + penalty}{RSS/(2*n) + penalty}
  for \code{"gaussian"} and
  \deqn{-\frac{1}{n} loglik + penalty}{-loglik/n + penalty}
  for \code{"binomial"}, where the likelihood is from a traditional
  generalized linear model for the log-odds of an event.  For logistic
  regression models, some care is taken to avoid model saturation; the
  algorithm  may exit early in this setting.
  
  For the bi-level selection methods, a locally approximated coordinate
  descent algorithm is employed.  For the group selection methods, group
  descent algorithms are employed.
  
  The algorithms employed by \code{grpreg} are stable and generally
  converge quite rapidly to values close to the solution.  However,
  especially when p is large compared with n, \code{grpreg} may fail to
  converge at low values of \code{lambda}, where models are
  nonidentifiable or nearly singular.  Often, this is not the region of
  the coefficient path that is most interesting.  The default behavior
  warning the user when convergence criteria are not met may be
  distracting in these cases, and can be modified with \code{warn}
  (convergence can always be checked later by inspecting the value of
  \code{iter}).

  If models are not converging, increasing \code{max.iter} may not be
  the most efficient way to correct this problem.  Consider increasing
  \code{n.lambda} or \code{lambda.min} in addition to increasing
  \code{max.iter}.

  Although \code{grpreg} allows groups to be unordered and given
  arbitary names, it is recommended that you specify groups as
  consecutive integers.  The first reason is efficiency: if groups are
  out of order, \code{X} must be reordered prior to fitting, then this
  process reversed to return coefficients according to the original
  order of \code{X}.  This is inefficient if \code{X} is very large.
  The second reason is ambiguity with respect to other arguments such as
  \code{group.multiplier}.  With consecutive integers, \code{group=3}
  unambiguously denotes the third element of \code{group.multiplier}.

  Seemingly unrelated regressions/multitask learning can be carried out
  using \code{grpreg} by passing a matrix to \code{y}.  In this case,
  \code{X} will be used in separate regressions for each column of
  \code{y}, with the coefficients grouped across the responses.  In
  other words, each column of \code{X} will form a group with m
  members, where m is the number of columns of \code{y}.  For multiple
  Gaussian responses, it is recommended to standardize the columns of
  \code{y} prior to fitting, in order to apply the penalization equally
  across columns.

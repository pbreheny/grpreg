Iteratively reweighted algorithms introduce scaling issues for nonconvex penalties. In **grpreg**, this is resolved through a technique called adaptive rescaling.

This issue is documented in more detail on the [ncvreg webpage](http://pbreheny.github.io/ncvreg/articles/web/adaptive-rescaling.html) and was originally proposed in the following manuscript:

* [Breheny P and Huang J (2011).  Coordinate descent algorithms for nonconvex penalized regression, with applications to biological feature selection.  *Annals of Applied Statistics*, 5: 232--253](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/pdf/Breheny2011.pdf)
